# NVIDIA NeMo Example

This repository has an example of how to use NeMo on Saturn Cloud. It runs on `saturn-nvidia-demo:1.5.1`, a pre-built image created by
NVIDIA and modified to use on Saturn Cloud. The example notebook is from the
[NeMo documentation](https://docs.nvidia.com/deeplearning/nemo/user-guide/docs/en/main/starthere/tutorials.html) but has been
lightly modified to use the pre-built image.
